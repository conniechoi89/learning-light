# Stack choices document

The tech stack choices specified here are as a result of consultation with Tiffany and Joel, and are as follows:

## Front end

React should be used for the front end, mainly for its responsiveness and ease of maintenance.

## Back end

Rails should be used for the back end, for ease of integration with Compass (which uses Rails).

## Database

Postgres should be used, mainly to ensure that data models are compatible with Compass.

## CSS framework

Bootstrap 4 should be used for layout and styling, for ease of integration with Compass and simpler maintainability.
